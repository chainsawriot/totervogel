The goal of totervogel is to detect malicious twitter accounts using Benford's Law.

Please refer to Golbeck (2015) and Golbeck (2019) for more details.

## Installation

You can install the development version of totervogel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chainsawriot/totervogel")
```

## Example

This is how my totervogel looks like:

```{r myaccount}
library(totervogel)
res <- create_totervogel("chainsawriot")
res
```

```{r plotmyaccount, echo = FALSE}
plot(res)
```

This is how a potentially malicious twitter account's totervogel looks like:

(Please don't visit the account.)

```{r malicious}


malicious_res <- create_totervogel("badluck_jones")
malicious_res
```

```{r plotmalicious, echo = TRUE}
plot(malicious_res)
```

```{r}
malicious_res$friends_benford
```

# Notes

* In Globeck (2015), 89.7% of Twitter users had a correction of over 0.9. Less than 1% had a correlation under 0.5. An account must be very suspicious to have such a low correction.

* Accounts with a lower friends count are more likely to detect a low Benfordness.
